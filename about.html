        <h1>What does web development mean?</h1>
        <p>Web development is simply how websites are built, implemented, and displayed on the internet. It pertains to the work behind the scenes that creates a functional website that performs a set of particular, defined functions. This includes various aspects of network security, web content development, web designing, web publishing, database management and more. And to make the website look better and work well, it needs the application of DOM or Document Object Mode; HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <h1>What is a web developer?</h1>
        <p>Web developers are programmers who specialize in the development of applications relating to the World Wide Web or distributed network applications. These network applications typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client browser using associated programming languages like JavaScript, C#, Ruby and PHP—to name a few.

          In simple words, web developers are programmers who use programming tools and write codes to “tell” a website what to do or how to function. They are like the directors and scriptwriters behind every movie.</p>
